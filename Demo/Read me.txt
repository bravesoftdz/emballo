This is a very simple demo that shows Emballo's features.

The application just displays a greeting message to the user based on
the current time.

There are two services that get injected:
  * IGreetingService is used to analyse the current time and returns
    the greeting message.

  * ITimeService is used by IGreetingService to get the current time.
    It is a abstraction layer over the windows time routines

When the main form is created, it asks Emballo to perform the so called
"hidden injection". This kind of injection consists of getting all
fields of the object where the injections will occur and inject the
dependecies on the apropriated fields. This will put an implementation
of IGreetingService inside the form.

There are three implementations of IGreetingService, each one showing
a different way of getting the ITimeService implementation. Please look
at the .dpr for more details.
